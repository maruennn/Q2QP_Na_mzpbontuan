                    <p>In 2013, FAB was rebranded as International Cat Care, in light of its role in feline medicine and welfare all over the world. Joan Judd, the charity’s founder and by then over 90 years old, was very supportive of this change, saying that this was how she imagined the charity could progress all those years ago. She died later that year, but we were so delighted that she had seen all of her hard work and struggle at the beginning come to fruition in helping millions of cats worldwide.</p>
